        <p>
     Art and crafts help young children explore and express their emotions, share how they relate to their family and friends, talk about their difficulties, their future dreams and aspirations, even if they have not yet developed a full vocabulary to do so. It also develops courage and a healthy self-esteem. Crafting is very enjoyable for me because I make things that I can be proud of. Also, you can have fun by thinking of what to make and while you are making it. I get ideas from the places I go and what I look at. ... This is why I like to craft.
